# ICD20 Homework3  

#### Introducton to Compiler Design - Wuu Yang

#### Objective:
- build AST for mini-pascal
- do **some** semantic analyses
- build symbol table for each scope

#### feature of the parser
- implement the concept of inheritance in C
- Using linkedlist as symbol table, slow but easy to implement

#### PS:
The construction of AST is implement in a very ugly way.  
And it's not fully support features of mini-pascal.

#### There're some known bugs
- multi array argument
